      Companion Diskette for "Programming Windows"
      (c) Charles Petzold, 1992
     ----------------------------------------------

This diskette contains source code and executable (.EXE) files for all the
sample programs described in the third edition of "Programming Windows" by
Charles Petzold (Microsoft Press, 1992). The programs are stored in
subdirectories corresponding to the book chapters.

In the root directory of the companion diskette, you'll find four batch files
named MSC.BAT, BCP.BAT, MSCDLL.BAT, and BCPDLL.BAT. Before compiling the
programs, you must execute MSC.BAT and MSCDLL.BAT if you are using Microsoft
C/C++ 7.0, or BCP.BAT and BCPDLL.BAT if you're using Borland C++ 3.1.

If you want to recreate all the .EXE files, you can run the MAKEMSC.BAT batch
file (for the Microsoft compiler) or MAKEBCP.BAT for the Borland compiler.
